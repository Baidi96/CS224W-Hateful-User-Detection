Updated model.py code for https://github.com/manoelhortaribeiro/GraphSageHatefulUsers, fixed some bugs & added precision logging & correct recall/f1 logging. Download the data, clone the original repo and replace the model.py file, then
```
python -m graphsage.model
```
should do the work and report the correct statistics

We sincerely thank Manoel for responding to our questions quickly and sharing his code publicly for reproducing the experiments
